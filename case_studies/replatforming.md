## Context

- A company had started a new project to replatform a business-critical
  application for one of their clients to Phoenix LiveView.
- The project had a tight deadline. Success or failure to meet that
  deadline would have consequences towards future work with their
  client.
- The original application was written in a programming language and
  framework that were difficult to understand, had a lot of duplication
  as well as confusing abstractions, and was not well organized.
- While the team had made inroads into understanding the application and
  automatically generating simpler features, they were concerned that
  they would not meet their deadlines.

## Solution

- We not only rapidly onboarded ourselves to the new application, but
  learned the programming language and framework used by the legacy
  application.
- We helped the team to learn new testing patterns, which could be
  written more quickly and could be more easily re-used elsewhere in the
  application.
- We introducing code design patterns for organizing Phoenix and Ecto,
  which improved developer velocity by improving code readability and
  re-usability.
