## Context

- The team had an existing web application written in Phoenix LiveView,
  a SaaS product in the education space.
- Users included teachers and school administrators, who typically only
  had time in the summer months to adapt to major changes or new feature
  sets.
- An suite of new features were planned for the year, with a pressing
  deadline approaching with summer months.
- The team's velocity of shipping new features indicated that they were
  not going to meet their deadlines.

## Solution

- We helped the team by introducing design pattern, improving their test
  suite, and helping to architect the new feature set, such that not
  only were we able to ship code faster, but the entire team was able to
  increase their velocity.
- We introduced patterns of developer workflow automation, such that
  less time was spent by each developer setting up and managing their
  codebases, and shipping new code.
- We helped to onboard new team members and train them in development
  practices, allowing the team to add less-experienced developers to the
  project while increasing their long-term velocity.
