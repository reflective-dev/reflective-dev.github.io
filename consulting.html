        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
          With a strong focus on developer tooling, automated testing, and observability tools, we help teams to reduce
          onboarding time of new software engineers, and to remove the pains of development processes. We reduce the
          risks of shipping new software, increasing the speed of development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re strong advocates of automated testing, and can kickstart or improve your applications’ test suites. We
          have experience testing at all levels (including unit tests, UI tests, integration tests, and API tests), and
          have released numerous open source libraries to help with testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have strong web app and web UI skills, having built many web applications on our own and alongside our
          clients’ developers, including multi-user multi-role enterprise workflow applications, and a videoconferencing
          server with a web-based client. We have added web-based dashboards showing application performance and status
          as well as real-time remote visualization of high-volume data transformations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use a lot of open source software, and we contribute back with pull requests and by creating our own
          <a href="/open-source">open source libraries and tools</a>.

        <h3>Elixir</h3>

        <p>
          We have been building applications in Elixir since 2018, and have deployed over a dozen Elixir applications in
          that time. We have also published and maintain
          <a href="/open-source">many open source libraries</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have decades of experience developing well-tested code, and have brought our testing philosophy to Elixir
          with Phoenix LiveView UI test suites (that run in seconds), as well as test-related open source libraries such
          as
          <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/pages" target="_blank">Pages</a>,
          <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/html_query" target="_blank">HtmlQuery</a>,
          <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/xml_query" target="_blank">XmlQuery</a>, and
          <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/schema_assertions" target="_blank">Schema Assertions</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to UI-heavy applications, we have shipped multiple data processing applications. We have used
          libraries such as Broadway, GenStage, Flow, Membrane, and Oban, as well as high-volume and high-speed data
          processing applications using tools provided by the Erlang and Elixir standard libraries.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have solved problems related to strict concurrency limits, API interoperability with little, no, or
          incorrect documentation, and the need for high reliability and speed (for instance, reducing a 12-hour long
          process to under 2 minutes).
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>CSV imports and exports</li>
          <li>Excel imports and exports</li>
          <li>XML parsing and generation</li>
          <li>Event sourcing of high-volume data pipelines</li>
          <li>Streaming data</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rust</h3>

        <p>
          We have built CLIs and terminal UIs in Rust, that we and teams we’ve worked with use every day. We have also
          used Rust at the core of Elixir NIFs for high speed data processing, as well as for interoperability with
          <a href="https://github.com/synchronal/specter" target="_blank">Rust libraries such as webrtc-rs</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our experience has focused on using Elixir as a main orchestrator for server operations, but we’d love to work
          more with Rust in terms of implementing core application logic shareable between multiple languages, such as
          Elixir and Swift.
        </p>

        <h3>Developer workflow and tooling</h3>

        <p>
          We care a lot about developer workflow, and believe that team members should be able to onboard onto new
          projects within minutes. New hires should be able to ship code on their first day, with a safety harness of
          tooling to ensure they are able to do so confidently while reducing annoyances.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this purpose, we have built two tools:
          <a href="https://github.com/synchronal/medic-rs" target="_blank">Medic</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/synchronal/dyd" target="_blank">Daily Diff</a>.
