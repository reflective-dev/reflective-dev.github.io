              Software is hypothetical until it’s exercised in production. Our focus
              is to get our software into production as rapidly as possible, with as few risks as
              possible.

              Edge cases emerge as soon as software is out of your hands and into your customers’. By
              shortening the cycle between building and shipping, we learn and adapt more quickly.

        <h3><a href="https://rankedplacement.com">Ranked Placement</a></h3>

        <p>
          We launched Ranked Placement at the beginning of 2025. It is a web-based platform that places students
          and other prospective interns at internship and practica sites by letting students and sites rank each other
          and then making the best match, using the same matching algorithm as medical student residency matching.
        </p>

        <p>
          For our first customer, we successfully placed hundreds of interns at just over a hundred internship sites,
          and we are ready to host your matching process. Read more at <a href="https://rankedplacement.com">rankedplacement.com</a>,

        <h3><a href="https://www.testreflector.app">Test Reflector</a></h3>

        <p>
          With dozens of open-source repositories and a host of personal and private projects that we maintain, we found
          that we needed a better tool for tracking GitHub Actions—especially on the days where we update dependencies
          across 40+ repos. Thus <a href="https://www.testreflector.app">Test Reflector</a> was born.
        </p>

        <p>
          Test Reflector provides a concise overview of CI workflow statuses and recent results across repositories,
          eliminating the need to constantly switch tabs or watch your email for failure notices. The application targets
          iOS as well as macOS. We wrote the core of the application in Rust, for its type safety, stability,
          headless testability, and cross-platform portability, bridged with Swift for the UI.

        <h3>Replatforming a mission-critical legacy codebase</h3>

        <p>
          A Fortune 500 company relied on a legacy business-critical application for worldwide budgeting. This decades-old
          application was difficult to understand, to modify, and to maintain. Operations had been outsourced, and no
          team within the company had the expertise to continue development on this application.
        </p>

        <p>
          We joined an existing team of developers who had just begun replatforming the application to Elixir and Phoenix.
          In addition to feature development, we introduced software design patterns that increased the team’s ability to
          ship code quickly, and we helped bring the team’s less-experienced Elixir developers up to speed.

        <h3>Building a carbon emissions data pipeline</h3>

        <p>
          A large global logistics company wanted to operationalize the tracking of their greenhouse gas emissions.
          Their data team could manually create emissions reports, taking days or weeks to produce; the company
          wanted to provide on-demand real-time emissions data to their customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We joined a team of developers who had just begun building the new application. We built the initial data
          pipeline that pulled data from a large data lake as well as from external APIs, performed real-time emissions
          calculations, and created streaming exports capable of generating 100M row Excel sheets. We developed PostgreSQL
          queries capable of summarizing and calculating emissions over 100s of millions of records in real-time using
          optimized common table expressions (CTEs). We also trained developers new to Elixir in testing and coding paradigms.

        <h3>Processing a multi-year healthcare data backlog</h3>

        <p>
          A state department of health had a multi-year backlog of COVID-19 health care data that epidemiologists needed
          access to in order to perform comorbidity analysis. Processing the data required interacting with 6 different
          health information exchanges (HIE), each of which had different resource thresholds and concurrencty limits. While
          documenting that they supported the same HL7v3 API format, each HIE’s API demonstrated inconsistences and unique
          response behaviors. New daily data dumps continually increased the size of the backlog, as well as changed the priority
          of existing records depending on certain markers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We rapidly developed a data pipeline application with built-in real-time dashboards for monitoring and reconfiguring
          concurrency. We interacted with HIE personnel to investigate their APIs, develop workarounds for unintended API
          behaviors, and help them to identify and apply fixes where possible. The deployed application used resilient
          architectural patterns that allowed for real-time reprioritization, idempotency, error recovery, and observability.
